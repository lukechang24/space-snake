# SPACE SNAKE
A game inspired by the classic "Snake" game, with power-ups, asteroids, and lasers.

# Instructions
You maneuver your snake with the arrow keys, and can't move in the opposite direction of the way you're going.  
Your goal is to eat as many stars as you can while dodging random asteroids. As you eat more  
stars, you are able to shoot down the asteroids for more points using the "s" key. Every once  
in a while, a power-up will spawn, granting you a random effect of infinite ammo, decrease  
movement speed, or stop time, for 10 seconds.

# Challenges I Faced
The biggest challenge that I faced is that I couldn't really study other people's code for  
their snake game, mainly because they used canvas. I still managed to make this game with pure  
javascript, HTML5, and css, but my options to improve the game were limited due to my lack of  
knowledge regarding canvas. Also, I would consider my CSS as the worst out of the three languages,  
so it was difficult to make my snake game look how I wanted it to look.

# My Favorite Part
I really enjoyed making the different power-ups, because it allowed me to take the basic snake game  
to another level. It was fun coming up with ideas for new power-ups to add, and I really enjoyed  
watching other people play my game and be surprised by each power-up I implemented into the game.  
I also liked styling my game; Even though my CSS is not the best, it always felt satisfying when I  
managed to make my game look appealing.
